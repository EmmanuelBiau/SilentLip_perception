# Lips-perception project overview

This repository contains the codes used in a project investigating how the visual system entrained by speakers' lips movements tunes the auditory system and shapes behavioral outcomes in a simple tone detection task.

# Which files/codes does it contain?

- The video stimuli used in the tone detection task and in the silent movies perception-EEG task.
- The corresponding audio files to calculate the main theta activity between lips and envelope signals using Mutual Information spectrum.
- Lips signal extraction in each silent video stimulus.
- Analyses of Mutual Information (MI) between lips and auditory envelope time-series.
- Tone detection task and silent movie perception-EEG task.
- Performances and Entrainment analyses from the tone detection task.
- EEG data preprocessing / MI lips-eeg epochs at source level / Theta Phase coupling analyses between auditory and visual sources.

# Prerequisites

- Matlab (The MathWorks) - The code has been tested on Matlab R2018a.
- Fieltrip toolbox.
- Circular Statistics toolbox for Matlab.

# Getting started

- Download the .zip and unzip or clone to your favourite path.
- Make sure your Matlab, Fieldtrip and CircStat toolboxes,as well as data folders paths toolboxes are set.
- Walk through the example scripts.
- Try it on your own data.
