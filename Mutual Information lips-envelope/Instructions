Here are the codes to compute the Mutual Information spectrum between the lips movements and the auditory envelope time-series. 
The main steps are explicited with sections in the codes as following:
- resample the lips signals at 250 Hz;
- compute the audio envelope of the corresponding video and resample at 250 Hz (you will need to extract the audio track from the video 
  separately and save it in .wav before to be read by Matlab).
- compute the MI spectrum between the lips and envelope time-series for every stimuli;
- detect the frequency with the peak of MI between the two signals in the spectrum; plot it and sort it;
