In this folder, you will find the codes to extract the time-series of the lips movements from the video.
The video format has to be .mp4 to be read by matlab. No need for sound track.
The 3 main steps are explicited by separate sections in the code:
- Import the video- read a frame to select the lips zone;
- Convert the coordinates in the excel converter then copy them in the Matlab interactive window;
- Filter the video frames and detect the lips information - save the lips data (Stat_video_XXX) and a video of the marked lips.
